          <p class="text-center" id="introp">The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next Pirate King.</p>

              <h1 id="major">World</h1>
              <p id="minor">In One Piece, The World, is an as-yet unnamed planet on which One Piece takes place. While similar—if not identical—to Earth in many aspects, it is drastically different in others.</p> 
              <p id="minor">Dominating the world's surface is the Blue Sea, a body of saltwater broadly divided into quadrants: the East Blue, the West Blue, the North Blue, and the South Blue. These divisions are formed by two natural barriers that bisect the world at roughly perpendicular angles:</p>
              <ul id="minor">
                <li>The Grand Line, a relatively narrow strip of ocean infamous for its unnatural, rapidly-shifting climates and monstrous wildlife—as well as being enclosed by the completely wind- and current-free Calm Belt regions.</li>
                <li>The Red Line, a huge (and mostly barren) landmass that functions as the world's only true continent.</li>
                
              </ul>

            <div class="col-md">
              <p id="minor">All parts of the Blue Sea—Grand Line and Calm Belts included—contain numerous islands supporting many different degrees of life. Travel between these islands is relatively simple in the four Blues, but significantly more complex in the Grand Line, where (in addition to the aforementioned hazards) many islands produce unique magnetic fields that render the magnets of ordinary compasses useless, necessitating special "Log Pose" compasses.</p>

              <h1 id="major">Grand Line</h1>
              <p id="minor">Said to be a giant sea route which circumnavigates the world, it is the one sea where normal compasses fail. It is the destination of every pirate and the path that leads to unimaginable adventures. Most of the story is based in the Grand Line. The reason this sea is sought by a large number of pirates is that the greatest treasure "One Piece", left behind by the legendary pirate Gol D. Roger, is said to be on the final island of Grand Line ("Laugh Tale"). The Grand Line is divided into two halves by the red line. The first half, known as "Paradise" to the residents of the second half of the Grand Line, is wildly unpredictable and dangerous, but pales in comparison to the second half. The next half, which is said to be much more difficult and dangerous than the first half, is the "New World". The Four Emperors unofficially rule the New World.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8">
              <h1 id="major">Calm Belt</h1>
              <p id="minor">The Calm Belt is a sea area that surrounds each side of the Grand Line. No winds or sea currents can be found there, hence the name "Calm Belt". As a result, sailing through it is extremely difficult, especially because it is the nesting ground for the Sea Kings. However, Rayleigh swam from the Grand Line to Amazon Lily in the Calm Belt by himself after his ship was sunk in a storm.</p>

              <h1 id="major">Red Line</h1>
              <p id="minor">The Red Line is the one and only continent in the One Piece world. It traverses the entire world from north to south. The Red Line separates the two oceans into four smaller seas. One of the oceans forms the two seas, East Blue and South Blue, and the other one forms the North Blue and the West Blue. The Red Line is used by those traversing the Grand Line to separate the first half of the Grand Line and the "New World", as well as the initial starting place of one's journey through the Grand Line; it also exists as the only way to enter the Grand Line besides traveling over the Calm Belt, a highly dangerous prospect. The Holy Land of Mary Geoise is located on the Red Line, at the part where the Grand Line meets the "New World".</p>

            <div class="col-md-8">
              <h1 id="major">Sea Floor</h1>
              <p id="minor">Depth-wise, the Blue Sea ends at the Sea Floor, a constant landmass formed of the world's crust. Here, the Grand Line becomes somewhat less distinct from the other seas (though the Red Line remains largely impassable); aquatic life thrives in countless varieties, existing alongside volcanoes and trenches.<br> The Sea Floor begins at many different depths, with its nadir existing more than 10,000 meters below surface (a nadir that, ironically, contains the world-famous Fish-Man Island).</p>

              <h1 id="major">Sky Ocean</h1>
              <p id="minor">The Sky Ocean is a place that is unknown to most people in the Blue Sea. The reason for that is that the Sky Ocean is entirely made of clouds, which from the Blue Sea does not look like an ocean. The Sky Ocean clouds, however, are no normal clouds. There are two kinds of clouds, Sea Clouds and Island Clouds. Sea Clouds are just like water, which means that it can be sailed on if the ship is not heavy enough to sink through it, whereas Island Clouds are dense enough to carry all kinds of things. <br>
                There are different ways to get to the Sky Ocean from the Blue Sea. The only way that has been shown so far is the unorthodox and dangerous way in which the sailors have to take a Knock Up Stream, though it has been said that there is a second, slightly less dangerous way, called High West. In the Sky Ocean there are two known seas, the White Sea and the White White Sea.</p>
